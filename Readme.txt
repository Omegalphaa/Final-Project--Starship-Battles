This is a simple game that I made for a final Project for a Purdue University course. 

The GUI was made using NetBeans's GUI builder, but eveything else was made by me. 

Starship battles, at the time of writing, is a rogue like in which the player creates a ship by selecting multiple components then going through a combat gauntlet to see how far they can go.
