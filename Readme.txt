The folder ""Final Project; StarShip Battles"/src/game" contains all of the source files of this project.

The other required items are in their named PDF documents for easy viewing.

there may be an error about the icon for the window as it was given to the code in an absolute manner rather than a relative one so it may need to be updated to reflect as intended, or it could be commented out. Either works.

The program was entirely made in an unmanaged project in Vscode except for the GUIs which were made in netbeans.
Because of this there may be some problems of getting it to work in netbeans as intended. (if that is how this will be tested.)

To make up for some of these problems the provided folder contains an exe file that can run the game. The .jar file used to create the exe is included.

The downside of this is that the file will be quite large as the JRE had to be included to run the exe for computers that don't have one. This was done to playtest.
